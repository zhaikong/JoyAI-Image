## 🐶 JoyAI-Image

JoyAI-Image is a **unified multimodal foundation model** for image understanding, text-to-image generation, and instruction-guided image editing. It combines an 8B Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with a 16B Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT). A central principle of JoyAI-Image is the **closed-loop collaboration between understanding, generation, and editing**. Stronger spatial understanding improves grounded generation and contrallable editing through better scene parsing, relational grounding, and instruction decomposition, while generative transformations such as viewpoint changes provide complementary evidence for spatial reasoning.

## 💎 Highlights

- **Unified multimodal foundation**: one model family for understanding, generation, and editing through a shared MLLM-MMDiT interface.
- **Practical data and training recipe**: a scalable pipeline with spatial understanding data ([OpenSpatial](https://github.com/VINHYU/OpenSpatial)), long-text rendering data, editing data ([SpatialEdit](https://github.com/EasonXiao-888/SpatialEdit)), and multi-stage optimization strategies.
- **Awakened spatial intelligence**: stronger spatial understanding, controllable spatial editing, and novel-view-assisted reasoning through a bidirectional loop between understanding and generation.
- **Advanced visual generation**: strong long-text typography, layout fidelity, multi-view generation, and controllable editing with better preservation of scene structure.

### Multi-view Generation and Spatial Editing Showcase

JoyAI-Image showcases a spatially grounded generation and editing pipeline that supports multi-view generation, geometry-aware transformations, camera control, object rotation, and precise location-specific object editing. Across these settings, it preserves scene content, structure, and visual consistency while following viewpoint-sensitive instructions more accurately.

### Spatial Editing for Spatial Reasoning Showcase

JoyAI-Image poses high-fidelity spatial editing, serving as a powerful catalyst for enhancing spatial reasoning. Compared with Qwen-Image-Edit and Nano Banana Pro, JoyAI-Image-Edit synthesizes the most diagnostic viewpoints by faithfully executing camera motions. These high-fidelity novel views effectively disambiguate complex spatial relations, providing clearer visual evidence for downstream reasoning.

### 3. Spatial Editing Reference

JoyAI-Image supports three spatial editing prompt patterns: **Object Move**, **Object Rotation**, and **Camera Control**. For the most stable behavior, we recommend following the prompt templates below as closely as possible.
For more information (including data curation and evaluation strategies), please refer to [SpatialEdit](https://github.com/EasonXiao-888/SpatialEdit).

#### 3.1 Object Move

Use this pattern when you want to move a target object into a specified region.

**Prompt template:**

```text
Move the <object> into the red box and finally remove the red box.
```

**Rules:**

* Replace `<object>` with a clear description of the target object to be moved.
* The **red box** indicates the target destination in the image.
* The phrase **"finally remove the red box"** means the guidance box should not appear in the final edited result.

**Example:**

```text
Move the apple into the red box and finally remove the red box.
```

#### 3.2 Object Rotation

Use this pattern when you want to rotate an object to a specific canonical view.

**Prompt template:**

```text
Rotate the <object> to show the <view> side view.
```

**Supported `<view>` values:**

```
front, right, left, rear, front right, front left, rear right, rear left
```

**Rules:**

* Replace `<object>` with a clear description of the object to rotate.
* Replace `<view>` with one of the supported directions above.
* This instruction is intended to change the **object orientation**, while keeping the object identity and surrounding scene as consistent as possible.

**Examples:**

```text
Rotate the chair to show the front side view.
Rotate the car to show the rear left side view.
```

#### 3.3 Camera Control

Use this pattern when you want to change only the camera viewpoint while keeping the 3D scene itself unchanged.

**Prompt template:**

```text
Move the camera.
- Camera rotation: Yaw {y_rotation}°, Pitch {p_rotation}°.
- Camera zoom: in/out/unchanged.
- Keep the 3D scene static; only change the viewpoint.
```

**Rules:**

* `{y_rotation}` specifies the yaw rotation angle in degrees.
* `{p_rotation}` specifies the pitch rotation angle in degrees.
* `Camera zoom` must be one of: `in`, `out`,`unchanged`
* The last line is important: it explicitly tells the model to preserve the 3D scene content and geometry, and only adjust the camera viewpoint.

**Examples:**

```text
Move the camera.
- Camera rotation: Yaw 45°, Pitch 0°.
- Camera zoom: in.
- Keep the 3D scene static; only change the viewpoint.
```

```text
Move the camera.
- Camera rotation: Yaw -90°, Pitch 20°.
- Camera zoom: unchanged.
- Keep the 3D scene static; only change the viewpoint.
```

#### 3.4 Application

**3D Reconstruction:**

The first and third examples show point clouds with only a single given viewpoint. The second and fourth examples are augmented by [SpatialEdit](https://github.com/EasonXiao-888/SpatialEdit), which synthesizes richer spatial observations from the sparse input view.

  <img src="assets/application/3dpoint/12.gif" width="23%" />
</p>

**Conditional-frames Based Video Generation:**

Given the first frame, [SpatialEdit](https://github.com/EasonXiao-888/SpatialEdit) first generates the final frame of the video, and a video generation model then creates a smooth rotational transition between them while maintaining background consistency.
